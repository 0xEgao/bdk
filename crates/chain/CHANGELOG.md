## [chain-0.23.1]

### Added

- Add new tests covering excluded bounds and the `SpkTxOutIndex::outputs_in_range` #1897
- Add new `reindex_tx_graph` benchmark, and unit test to cover `spk_cache` behavior #1968
- Add new `TxGraph::get_last_evicted` method #1977

### Changed

- Improve API docs, fixed parameter names to match the function or struct definition, and correct some spelling mistakes. #1968
- `KeychainTxOutIndex::apply_changeset` restores spk_cache before last revealed #1993
- deps: bump bdk_core to 0.6.1

### Fixed
- During canonicalization, exclude coinbase transactions when considering txs that are anchored in stale blocks #1976

## [chain-0.23.0]

### Added

- feat!(chain): implement `first_seen` tracking #1950
- fix(chain): persist `first_seen` #1966
- Persist spks derived from KeychainTxOutIndex #1963

### Changed

- fix(docs): `merge_chains` outdated documentation #1806
- chore: create and apply rustfmt.toml #1946
- chore: Update rust-version to 1.86.0 #1955
- bump bdk_core to 0.6.0

## [chain-0.22.0]

### Added

- Introduce evicted-at/last-evicted timestamps #1839
- Add method for constructing TxGraph from a ChangeSet #1930
- docs: Architectural Decision Records #1592
- Introduce canonicalization parameters #1808
- Add conversion impls for CanonicalTx to Txid/Arc<Transaction>.
- Add ChainPosition::is_unconfirmed method.

### Changed

- Make full-scan/sync flow easier to reason about. #1838
- Change `TxGraph` to track `last_evicted` timestamps. This is when a transaction is last marked as missing from the mempool.
- The canonicalization algorithm now disregards transactions with a `last_evicted` timestamp greater than or equal to it's `last_seen` timestamp, except when a canonical descendant exists due to rules of transitivity. #1839
- deps: bump miniscript to 12.3.1 #1924

### Fixed

- Fix canonicalization mess-up when transactions that conflict with itself are inserted. #1917

### Removed

- Remove `apply_update_at` as we no longer need to apply with a timestamp after-the-fact.

## [chain-0.21.1]

### Changed

- Minor updates to fix new rustc 1.83.0 clippy warnings #1776
