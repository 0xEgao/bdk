## [bitcoind_rpc-0.21.0]

### Added

- Introduce usage of `cfg_attr(coverage_nightly)` in order to not consider tests under coverage. #1986

### Changed

- deps: bump bdk_core to 0.6.1

### Fixed

- Some mempool transactions not being emitted at all, it was fixed by simplifying the emitter, and replaced the avoid-re-emission-logic with a new one that emits all mempool transactions. #1988
- Use the `getrawmempool` without verbose, as a more performant method. `Emitter::mempool` method now requires the `std` feature. A non-std version of this is added: `Emitter::mempool_at` #1988

## [bitcoind_rpc-0.20.0]

### Changed

### Changed

- feat(rpc)!: Update Emitter::mempool to support evicted_at #1857
- Change Emitter::mempool to return MempoolEvents which contain mempool-eviction data.

- deps: bump `bdk_core` to 0.5.0
